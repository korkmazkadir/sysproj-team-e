1)launch 50000 threads, expect: no hard crashes, 

2)Halt main thread before created threads end, expect: created threads still run to completion, then program terminates

3)call halt from a created thread??  expect ??

4)pass NULL arguments (function ptr and / or argument)to UserThreadCreate expect: kernel stops program, no hard crashes

5)pass Pointers that are pointing to another thread's local variables / stack? excpect: program still runs but produces bad output / results...?

6)
