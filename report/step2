2) Specification 

void PutChar (char c)
writes the character c to standard output.

void SynchPutString(char *c)
writes  the  string  s to standard output, without its terminating null byte ('\0').

char SynchGetChar()
reads the next character from standard input, and returns it as a char. Returns EOF if no character is buffered.

void SynchGetString(char *s, int n)
reads in at most n-1 characters from stdin and stores them into the buffer pointed to by s. Reading stops after an EOF or newline. If a newline is read, it is stored into the buffer. A terminating null byte ('\0') is stored after the  last  character in the buffer. The character code 127 is handled as EOF.

void SynchPutInt(int n)
writes the decimal notation of n to standard output, without its terminating null byte ('\0').

void SynchGetInt(int *n)
reads the first integer from standard input and stores it into the variable pointed to by n.


3) Implementation details
PutChar / GetChar:
In order to handle concurrent calls to the synchconsole printing functions, two versions of PutChar exist. The public version uses a semaphore for synchronization (ex: avoiding running a putchar while another process was doing putstring). The private version is destined to be called by putstring, and therefore it does not require synchronization since this is handled by putstring.
The same principle is applied to GetChar and GetString.

GetChar / GetString:
Given that the console class's getChar returns a char, we cannot distinguish between EOF and character code 127. We chose to interpret code 127 as EOF.

GetString / PutString:
If the string to be read or written is longer than MAX_WRITE_BUF_SIZE (defined in system.h), the string will be truncated to fit the buffer: MAX_WRITE_BUF_SIZE elements are written / read.
In the case of GetString, this means the remaining characters are still available to be read with a second GetString.
